# Escaping Special Symbols Demo

This is a demonstration of how special symbols like `*` are escaped in Markdown.

## Asterisks

To display an asterisk (\*) without triggering Markdown formatting, you can use a backslash: `\*`.

## Code Blocks

You can also display code blocks inline using backticks (\`). For example, `var x = 5;`.

## Backslashes

To display a backslash (\\) itself, you need to escape it with another backslash: \\\\.
