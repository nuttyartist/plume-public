# Blockquote Demonstration

Blockquotes can contain various Markdown elements, including code blocks and other formatting.

## Syntax

You can create a blockquote by adding a `>` character before the quoted text. You can also nest blockquotes by using multiple `>` characters.

### Example

> This is a simple blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

You can also include other Markdown elements within blockquotes:

> Here's a list:
> - Item 1
> - Item 2
> - Item 3

And you can nest blockquotes as well:

> This is a level 1 blockquote.
>
> > This is a nested level 2 blockquote.
> >
> > > This is a nested level 3 blockquote.

## Code Blocks

You can include code blocks within blockquotes:

> Here's an example of a code block:
>
> ```
> def greet(name):
>     print(f"Hello, {name}!")
> ```
>
> And here's inline code: `print("Markdown is great!")`
