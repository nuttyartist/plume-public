# Permissive E-mail Autolinks

With the flag `MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEEMAILAUTOLINKS`, MD4C enables more permissive
recognition of e-mail addresses and transforms them to autolinks, even if they
do not exactly follow the syntax of autolink as specified in CommonMark
specification.

This is standard CommonMark e-mail autolink:

```````````````````````````````` example
E-mail: <mailto:john.doe@gmail.com>
.
<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:john.doe@gmail.com">mailto:john.doe@gmail.com</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

With the permissive autolinks enabled, this is sufficient:

```````````````````````````````` example
E-mail: john.doe@gmail.com
.
<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:john.doe@gmail.com">john.doe@gmail.com</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

`+` can occur before the `@`, but not after.

```````````````````````````````` example
hello@mail+xyz.example isn't valid, but hello+xyz@mail.example is.
.
<p>hello@mail+xyz.example isn't valid, but <a href="mailto:hello+xyz@mail.example">hello+xyz@mail.example</a> is.</p>
````````````````````````````````

`.`, `-`, and `_` can occur on both sides of the `@`, but only `.` may occur at
the end of the email address, in which case it will not be considered part of
the address:

```````````````````````````````` example
a.b-c_d@a.b

a.b-c_d@a.b.

a.b-c_d@a.b-

a.b-c_d@a.b_
.
<p><a href="mailto:a.b-c_d@a.b">a.b-c_d@a.b</a></p>
<p><a href="mailto:a.b-c_d@a.b">a.b-c_d@a.b</a>.</p>
<p>a.b-c_d@a.b-</p>
<p>a.b-c_d@a.b_</p>
````````````````````````````````
